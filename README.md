=========

This repository contains tools to manipulate PUD files. PUDs are Warcraft II map files.
The build system used is `cmake`:

- `mkdir -p build && cd build`
- `make`

To install:
- `sudo make install`
- Possibly `sudo ldconfig` on GNU/Linux

To uninstall:
- `sudo make uninstall`


libpud
------

A C library to manipulate a PUD file:
- extract all data from it;
- generate a custom PUD file;
- generate a bitmap of the minimap.


TODO:
- [ ] `pud_mmap()` is not implemented on systems which do not provide `mmap()`
- [ ] `pud_munmap()` is not implemented on systems which do not provide `munmap()`


libwar2
-------

A C library which aims at extracting data from Warcraft II data files to get:
- tilesets;
- units and buildings' sprites;
- musics and sounds;
- cinematics.


Graphical modules (optionals):
- libpng
- jpeglib


TODO:
- [ ] Icons' sprites
- [ ] Musics
- [ ] Sounds
- [ ] Cinematics


quicklook
---------

Quicklook plugin for OSX. Allows to preview minimaps of PUD files in the Finder.
Installation steps:
- `make quicklook`
- `sudo cp -r build/quicklook/Pud.qlgenerator /Library/QuickLook`


pud
---

A small tool that allows to interact with `libpud`.
It allows to export the minimap of a PUD to an image. Supported formats:
- jpg
- png
- ppm

tools
-----

Those binaries are mostly helpers to create the libraries.
- `defaults_gen`: used to generate parts of `libpud/defaults.c`
- `extract_tiles`: used to extract tiles from maindat.war (in `data/tiles`)
- `extract_sprites`: used to extract units and buildings' sprites from maindat.war (in `data/sprites`)
- `ppm_cmp`: makes a `diff` between 2 ppm files
- `tilemap`: used to generate parts of `libpud/tiles.c`
- `tiler`: generates a map with all possible tiles
- `tiles`: used to generate parts of `libpud/tiles.c`
